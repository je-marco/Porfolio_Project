## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID 19 Deaths and Vaccinations

This is the project I did for the Coursera Google Data Analytics course's case study, where I applied the skills that I learned to explore the COVID 19 data.

* Data was taken from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
* Used Microsoft's SQL Server to explore the data
* Used Tableau to visualize the data and create an interactive dashboard
