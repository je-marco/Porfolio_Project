# Data Analytics Porfolio
This portfolio project showcases my skill in data analytics. 

## Project 1: Monitoring of Bottle Manufacturing (Dashboard)

This is an interactive dashboard that I made while taking the Coursera's IBM Data Analytics with Excel and R. The dashboard was made in IBM Cognos Analytics to effectively monitor the bottle manufacturing process of a fictional industrial manufacturing. 

* The data sources was provided by the Coursera on-line training of Data Visualizations and can only be viewed if you are taking their course. However, I included a detailed documentation of the project to provide necessary description about the data sources, the dataset, calculations used, and the dashboard contents.
* Check [this google drive file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LB3fwR-dWvITBT0ZvAQDvDMqUNxaiECRwsPWzc8xpkc/edit?usp=sharing) for the documentaton.

## Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID 19 Deaths and Vaccinations

This is the project I did for the Coursera Google Data Analytics course's case study, where I applied the skills that I learned to explore the COVID 19 data.

* Data was taken from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
* Used Microsoft's SQL Server to explore the data. Click [here](https://github.com/je-marco/exploratory_data_analysis/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(COVID-19).sql) to access the SQL code.
* Used Tableau to visualize the data and create an interactive dashboard

## Project 3: Sales Dashboard for a Bakery Business

* This is a project that I made for a start-up bakery business named Freon's Homemade Sweets and Pastries
* Utilized CONDITIONAL FORMATTING to ensure accuracy in data entry of Income and Expenses
* Used functions such as PIVOT TABLE, VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, and CHARTS to build the dashboard
